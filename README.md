Why is data mining sometimes used to describe the entire knowledge discovery process? Data mining refers to using analytical techniques and algorithms to uncover hidden knowledge from large amounts of data.
because: It is the core and most recognizable step where insights are actually produced. Non‑technical fields often simplify terminology, merging all KDD tasks under data mining. Public perception tends to highlight the result‑generation step rather than the preparation steps like cleaning or integration. Thus, the term data mining becomes shorthand for the full knowledge discovery workflow.

Differences between data wrangling, scanning, and filtering in data mining
Data Wrangling Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and restructuring raw data to make it ready for analysis.

Key Points:
i Fixes errors and missing values
ii Converts formats 
iii Structures data for modeling

Scanning involves quickly examining the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential patterns or anomalies.

Key Points: 
i Gives an initial overview 
ii Helps spot outliers 
iii Supports early decision‑making

 Filtering is selecting or excluding parts of the data based on specific rules or criteria.

Key Points:
i Keeps only relevant observations 
ii Reduces noise
iii Helps narrow the focus of analysis
